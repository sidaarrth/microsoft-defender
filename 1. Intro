📚 Learning Microsoft Defender – My Self-Study Journey

Over the last few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into the Microsoft Defender ecosystem on my own time. What started as “just checking out Windows Defender” quickly opened up a whole world of security tools:

🔹 Defender for Endpoint – EDR, attack surface reduction rules, automated investigation & remediation.
🔹 Defender for Identity – spotting lateral movement and credential misuse.
🔹 Defender for Office 365 – phishing and malware protection across mail & collaboration.
🔹 Defender for Cloud – security posture management for Azure, AWS and GCP.

I’m fascinated by how all of this integrates into Microsoft 365 Defender and Sentinel to give a unified view of threats. It’s powerful stuff, and it’s been a great self-study project to understand how XDR actually works in the real world.

If you’re also exploring Microsoft security tools, what resources or tips helped you the most?
